# Breaking Bad Character Status

Hi there, Breaking Bad fans! 

This project that's mocked up and developed with **HTML, CCS and JS** was created so that you can search and find out your favorite character status, dead or alive, you can also choose and save your favorites.

By clicking the URL on this repository description you'll be redirected to the BB character status web.

## Usage

- **See all Breaking Bad characters and their status**: once the website loads it connects directly to an API (https://breakingbadapi.com/) which shows on screen a picture of all characters, their names and status. 

* **Search**: you can find the character you're looking for just by typing their name into the search bar. 

* **Create a favorites list**: clicking characters adds them to your favorites list, if you change your mind, you can always click them again to make them disappear from your list. Your favorites will remain on the Local Storage so you won't lose them, even if you refresh or close your tab. 

## Thank You!
